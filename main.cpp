Write a program that will exercise STD::array functions. Code a real-world simulation of something that could be simulated by an array. The requirements are:
    *Use an STD::array
    *Have an external data file with at least 30 elements in it
    *Read the data into an STD::array 
    *Use a large variety of the <array> member functions from this module to demonstrate your understanding of the STD::array.
